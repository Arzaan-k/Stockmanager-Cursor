# Context Loss Fix - After Name Input

## üîç **Issue Identified**

**Problem**: When user provides their name after product selection in add stock flow, the bot loses context and starts a new product search instead of continuing with stock addition confirmation.

**Sequence of Events**:
1. User selects "Carrier Data Recorder Sensor" from product selection
2. Bot asks: "Please tell me your name for the record:"
3. User provides: "Test"
4. **‚ùå BROKEN**: Bot immediately shows new product selection for "Twist Lock" and "Turpentine"

---

## üîß **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was in the flow detection logic. When the user provides their name, the bot was not properly detecting that it's in the stock addition flow and was falling through to normal intent detection, which treated "Test" as a product search query.

**Original Flow Detection**:
```typescript
else if (state.pendingStockAddition || 
         state.currentFlow === 'awaiting_name' || 
         state.currentFlow === 'adding_stock') {
  // Process as stock addition flow
}
```

**Problem**: The condition was not catching all cases where the bot should be in stock addition flow.

---

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Enhanced Flow Detection**
Added a fallback check to ensure stock addition flow is properly detected:

```typescript
// Primary flow detection
else if (state.pendingStockAddition || 
         state.currentFlow === 'awaiting_name' || 
         state.currentFlow === 'adding_stock') {
  // Process as stock addition flow
}
// Fallback flow detection
else if (state.pendingStockAddition && !state.pendingStockAddition.awaitingConfirmation && !state.userName) {
  // Process as stock addition flow (fallback)
}
```

### **2. Enhanced Debugging**
Added comprehensive logging to trace exactly where context is lost:

```typescript
console.log('Processing as stock addition flow - state:', {
  pendingStockAddition: !!state.pendingStockAddition,
  currentFlow: state.currentFlow,
  awaitingConfirmation: state.pendingStockAddition?.awaitingConfirmation,
  userName: state.userName,
  message: message
});
```

### **3. Fallback Detection**
Added additional logging for when the bot falls through to normal intent detection:

```typescript
console.log('Falling through to normal intent detection - state:', {
  pendingStockAddition: !!state.pendingStockAddition,
  currentFlow: state.currentFlow,
  lastContextType: state.lastContext?.type,
  message: message
});
```

## üß™ **Testing Instructions**

### **Test the Context Loss Fix**:

1. **Start Add Stock Flow**:
   - Click "Add Stock" button
   - Enter "5 units sensor"

2. **Select Product**:
   - Bot should show 3 product buttons
   - Select "Carrier Data Recorder Sensor"

3. **Provide Name**:
   - Bot should ask: "Please tell me your name for the record:"
   - Enter "Test"

4. **Expected Result**:
   - Bot should continue with stock addition confirmation
   - Should NOT show new product recommendations
   - Should ask for confirmation: "Reply with 'yes' to confirm or 'no' to cancel"

### **Check Console Logs**:

When testing, monitor the console logs to see:

**Expected Logs**:
```
Processing as stock addition flow - state: {
  pendingStockAddition: true,
  currentFlow: "adding_stock",
  awaitingConfirmation: false,
  userName: undefined,
  message: "Test"
}
```

**If Context is Lost**:
```
Falling through to normal intent detection - state: {
  pendingStockAddition: false,  // This should be true!
  currentFlow: "idle",
  lastContextType: undefined,
  message: "Test"
}
```

## üìä **Current Status**

| Issue | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **WhatsApp API Error** | ‚úÖ Fixed | Row titles truncated to 24 characters |
| **Product Selection** | ‚úÖ Fixed | Limited to top 3 most relevant products |
| **Context Loss** | üîß Enhanced | Added fallback flow detection and debugging |

## üîç **Debugging Information**

### **What to Look For**:

1. **Flow Detection**: Check if `pendingStockAddition` is `true` when user provides name
2. **State Persistence**: Verify that conversation state is maintained between messages
3. **Intent Detection**: Ensure bot doesn't fall through to normal intent detection

### **Key Debug Points**:

- **Button Click**: When user selects product, `pendingStockAddition` should be set
- **Name Input**: When user provides name, flow detection should catch it
- **State Maintenance**: `pendingStockAddition` should persist between messages
