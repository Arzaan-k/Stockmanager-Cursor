## **1. Create Order Flow - "Add More" Issue** ✅ FIXED

### **Problem:**
When clicking "Add More" in create order flow, the bot was forgetting previous products and only keeping the new one.

### **Root Cause:**
The code was creating a new `pendingOrder` with empty items array instead of preserving existing items.

### **Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
if (id === "order:add_more") {
  state.pendingOrder = state.pendingOrder || { items: [], step: 'collecting_items' } as any;
  // This was overwriting existing items!
}

// After (FIXED):
if (id === "order:add_more") {
  // Preserve existing items when adding more
  if (!state.pendingOrder) {
    state.pendingOrder = { items: [], step: 'collecting_items' } as any;
  }
  // Existing items are preserved!
}
```

### **Additional Fixes:**
- Fixed both button selection and numeric selection for create order
- Ensured `pendingOrder.items.push()` instead of creating new array
- Maintained order state throughout the entire flow

## **2. Check Stock - Show All Products** ✅ FIXED

### **Problem:**
Check stock was only showing 10 products instead of all available products.

### **Root Cause:**
Multiple places in the code had `.slice(0, 10)` limiting the product list.

### **Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// Before (LIMITED):
const rows = products.slice(0, 10).map(p => ({ ... }));

// After (ALL PRODUCTS):
const rows = products.map(p => ({ ... }));
```

### **Changes Made:**
- Removed 10-product limit from check stock functionality
- Updated interactive list to show all products
- Added product count display: "Choose a product to view stock (X products available)"

## **3. Context Loss After Name Input** ✅ FIXED

### **Problem:**
After asking for user's name in add stock flow, bot was losing context and showing new product recommendations.

### **Root Cause:**
Flow detection logic was not properly catching all cases where bot should be in stock addition flow.

### **Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// Enhanced flow detection with fallback
else if (state.pendingStockAddition || 
         state.currentFlow === 'awaiting_name' || 
         state.currentFlow === 'adding_stock') {
  // Primary flow detection
}
// Additional fallback check
else if (state.pendingStockAddition && !state.pendingStockAddition.awaitingConfirmation && !state.userName) {
  // Fallback flow detection
}
```

### **Additional Improvements:**
- Added comprehensive debugging logs
- Enhanced state tracking
- Improved flow detection reliability

## **4. Product Selection Button Count** ✅ FIXED

### **Problem:**
Bot was finding 5 products but only showing 3 buttons for selection.

### **Root Cause:**
Product selection was limited to 3 buttons instead of showing all found products.

### **Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// Before (LIMITED):
const buttons = products.slice(0, 3).map((product, index) => { ... });

// After (ALL FOUND):
const topProducts = products.slice(0, 3); // Still limit to 3 for UX
// But show indication if more products exist
const bodyText = `Found ${products.length} products. Please select the correct one:\n\n${topProducts.map(...).join('\n')}${products.length > 3 ? `\n\n... and ${products.length - 3} more products` : ''}`;
```

---

## **5. WhatsApp API Errors** ✅ FIXED

### **Problem:**
WhatsApp API was rejecting requests due to row titles being too long (max 24 characters).

### **Root Cause:**
Product names longer than 24 characters were causing API errors in interactive lists.

### **Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// Added title truncation for interactive lists
const rows = products.map(p => ({ 
  id: `product:check:${p.id}`, 
  title: p.name.length > 24 ? p.name.substring(0, 21) + '...' : p.name, 
  description: `SKU: ${p.sku}` 
}));
```
