# Check Stock - Text-Based Product Identification Fix

## ✅ **WhatsApp List Limit Error Fixed!**

### **🔍 Problem Identified:**
```
[WA] Send failed (status 400) for interactive_list: {"error":{"message":"(#131009) Parameter value is not valid","type":"OAuthException","code":131009,"error_data":{"messaging_product":"whatsapp","details":"Total row count exceed max allowed count: 10"},"fbtrace_id":"AIuaBG7oaIH0NkT5zP_khJH"}}
```

**Root Cause:** WhatsApp API has a maximum limit of 10 rows for interactive lists, but we were trying to show all products (potentially hundreds).

---

## **🔧 Solution Applied**

### **1. Replaced Interactive Lists with Text-Based Search**

**Before (BROKEN):**
- Used interactive lists to show all products
- Caused API errors when more than 10 products existed
- Limited user experience

**After (FIXED):**
- Text-based product identification
- No API limits
- Better user experience with search functionality

### **2. Enhanced Check Stock Functionality**

#### **New Check Stock Flow:**
1. **User clicks "Check Stock"** → Gets helpful instructions
2. **User types product name/SKU** → Bot searches and shows results
3. **Multiple products found** → Shows list with stock levels
4. **Single product found** → Shows detailed information with action buttons
5. **No products found** → Provides helpful suggestions

#### **Key Features:**
- **Smart Search**: Finds products by name, SKU, or partial matches
- **Multiple Results**: Shows up to 10 products with stock levels
- **Detailed View**: Single product shows comprehensive information
- **Helpful Suggestions**: Guides users when no products found
