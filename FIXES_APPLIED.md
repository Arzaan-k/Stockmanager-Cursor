# WhatsApp Bot Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ **Issues Fixed**

### **1. WhatsApp API Error - Row Titles Too Long**
**Status: ‚úÖ FIXED**

**Problem:** 
```
[WA] Send failed (status 400) for interactive_list: {"error":{"message":"(#131009) Parameter value is not valid","type":"OAuthException","code":131009,"error_data":{"messaging_product":"whatsapp","details":"Row title is too long. Max length is 24"},"fbtrace_id":"AE-6pDmOLeEuQ0gmo7czPxR"}}
```

**Solution:**
- Added title truncation for interactive list rows in check stock functionality
- Product names longer than 24 characters are now truncated to 21 characters + "..."
- This prevents the WhatsApp API error when showing product lists

**Code Change:**
```typescript
const rows = products.slice(0, 10).map(p => ({ 
  id: `product:check:${p.id}`, 
  title: p.name.length > 24 ? p.name.substring(0, 21) + '...' : p.name, 
  description: `SKU: ${p.sku}` 
}));
```

### **2. Product Selection Limited to Top 3 Most Relevant**
**Status: ‚úÖ FIXED**

**Problem:** 
- Bot was showing buttons for 5 products but only 3 were actually selectable
- Inconsistent user experience

**Solution:**
- Limited product selection to top 3 most relevant products
- Updated display to show "Found X products" but only show buttons for top 3
- Added indication when there are more products available

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Create buttons for top 3 most relevant products
const topProducts = products.slice(0, 3);
const bodyText = `Found ${products.length} products. Please select the correct one:\n\n${topProducts.map((p, i) => 
  `${i + 1}. ${p.name} (SKU: ${p.sku}) - Stock: ${p.stockAvailable}`
).join('\n')}${products.length > 3 ? `\n\n... and ${products.length - 3} more products` : ''}`;
```

### **3. Context Loss After Name Input**
**Status: üîç DEBUGGING ADDED**

**Problem:**
- After user provides their name, bot loses context and shows product recommendations again
- Flow breaks and doesn't proceed to confirmation

**Debugging Added:**
- Enhanced logging in `handleTextMessage` to track flow state
- Added detailed debugging in `handleStockAddition` to trace state changes
- Added flow detection logging to identify where context is lost

**Debug Information Now Logged:**
```typescript
console.log('handleTextMessage called:', {
  message,
  currentFlow: state.currentFlow,
  hasPendingStockAddition: !!state.pendingStockAddition,
  awaitingConfirmation: state.pendingStockAddition?.awaitingConfirmation,
  userName: state.userName,
  lastContextType: state.lastContext?.type,
  pendingOrder: !!state.pendingOrder
});
```

## **Current Status**

| Issue | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **WhatsApp API Error** | ‚úÖ Fixed | Row titles truncated to 24 characters max |
| **Product Selection** | ‚úÖ Fixed | Limited to top 3 most relevant products |
| **Context Loss** | üîç Debugging | Added comprehensive logging to identify root cause |

## **Testing Instructions**

### **Test 1: Check Stock Functionality**
1. Click "Check Stock" button
2. Verify product list shows without API errors
3. Check that product names are properly truncated if too long

### **Test 2: Product Selection (Add Stock)**
1. Click "Add Stock" ‚Üí Enter "5 units sensor"
2. Verify only 3 product buttons are shown
3. Verify message shows "Found X products" but only 3 buttons
4. Select a product and provide your name
5. **Monitor console logs** to see if context is maintained

### **Test 3: Product Selection (Create Order)**
1. Click "Create Order" ‚Üí Enter "10 units socket"
2. Verify only 3 product buttons are shown
3. Select a product and verify order flow continues

---

## **Next Steps**

### **For Context Loss Issue:**
1. **Test the flow** with the new debugging enabled
2. **Check console logs** when providing name after product selection
3. **Look for** where `pendingStockAddition` state is being lost
4. **Identify** the exact point where flow detection fails

### **Expected Debug Output:**
When testing, you should see logs like:
```
handleTextMessage called: {
  message: "Test",
  currentFlow: "adding_stock",
  hasPendingStockAddition: true,
  awaitingConfirmation: false,
  userName: undefined,
  lastContextType: undefined,
  pendingOrder: false
}
```

If `hasPendingStockAddition` is `false` when it should be `true`, that's where the context is being lost.
