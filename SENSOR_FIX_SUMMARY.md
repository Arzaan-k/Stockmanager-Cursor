# Sensor Product Selection Fix

## Problem Identified
The issue was that the `extractProductAndQuantity` method in the `EnhancedWhatsAppService` was still using the old logic that always returned a single product, even when multiple products matched the search query.

## Root Cause
```typescript
// OLD CODE - Always returned single product
const exactMatch = products.find(p => 
  p.name.toLowerCase() === productName.toLowerCase() ||
  p.name.toLowerCase().includes(productName.toLowerCase())
);
product = exactMatch || products[0]; // This always selected one product
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced `extractProductAndQuantity` Method
- Modified to return both `product` (single) and `products` (array)
- Added logic to detect when multiple products are found
- Returns single product only when exactly one match found
- Returns products array when multiple matches found

### 2. Updated `handleStockAddition` Method
- Added check for `products` array from `extractProductAndQuantity`
- When multiple products found, shows selection buttons immediately
- Maintains backward compatibility for single product matches

## Code Changes

### Before (Problematic):
```typescript
// Always returned single product
const { productName, quantity, product } = await this.extractProductAndQuantity(message);

// Multiple product logic only triggered when no product found
if (!product && productName) {
  // This never executed because product was always found
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// Returns both single product and products array
const { productName, quantity, product, products } = await this.extractProductAndQuantity(message);

// Multiple product logic triggered when products array has items
if (products && products.length > 1) {
  // Show selection buttons immediately
  await this.sendProductSelectionButtons(userPhone, products, quantity || 1, 'add_stock');
  return "";
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **User Input**: "50 units of sensor"
2. **Search**: `extractProductAndQuantity` finds multiple sensor products
3. **Detection**: Method returns `products` array instead of single `product`
4. **Selection**: `handleStockAddition` detects multiple products and shows buttons
5. **User Choice**: User clicks button or types number to select specific product
6. **Confirmation**: System proceeds with selected product

## Files Modified
- `server/services/whatsapp-enhanced.ts` - Fixed the core logic

## Testing
The fix can be tested by:
1. Sending "50 units of sensor" to the WhatsApp bot
2. Verifying that multiple sensor products are shown as buttons
3. Testing both button clicks and numeric selection
4. Confirming the flow continues to stock addition

## Expected Behavior
- **Before**: Bot directly selected "Carrier Data Recorder Sensor" without showing options
- **After**: Bot shows multiple sensor products as interactive buttons for user selection
