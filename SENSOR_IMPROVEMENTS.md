# Sensor Product Selection Improvements

## Problem
When users provided vague product names like "sensor", the bot would directly identify a single product (e.g., "Carrier Data Recorder Sensor") without showing other related products, even when multiple products with "sensor" in the name existed in the database.

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive product selection system that shows multiple related products as interactive buttons when vague product names are provided.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Product Search Logic (`server/services/gemini.ts`)
- Modified `generateWhatsAppResponse` function to detect when multiple products match a vague query
- Added logic to combine exact and fuzzy search results
- Implemented special response format for multiple product matches
- Added proper conversation state management for product selection

### 2. Interactive Button System (`server/services/whatsapp-enhanced.ts`)
- Added `sendProductSelectionButtons` method to send WhatsApp interactive buttons
- Created `handleProductSelectionButton` method to handle button clicks
- Added `handleNumericProductSelection` method as fallback for text-based selection
- Updated main message handler to detect product selection interactions

### 3. Enhanced Conversation Flow
- Added support for `product_selection` context type
- Implemented button-based product selection with proper state management
- Added fallback to numeric selection for compatibility
- Integrated with existing stock addition and order creation flows

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: User sends "50 units of sensor"
2. **Product Search**: System searches for products containing "sensor"
3. **Multiple Matches**: If multiple products found, system shows interactive buttons
4. **User Selection**: User clicks button or types number to select specific product
5. **Confirmation**: System proceeds with selected product and asks for user name

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: Up to 3 products shown as clickable buttons
- **Text Fallback**: Numeric selection (1, 2, 3) for compatibility
- **Smart Search**: Combines exact and fuzzy search for better results
- **State Management**: Proper conversation state tracking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and error messages

## Testing

The improvements can be tested by:
1. Sending "50 units of sensor" to the WhatsApp bot
2. Verifying that multiple sensor products are shown as buttons
3. Testing both button clicks and numeric selection
4. Confirming the flow continues to stock addition

## Files Modified

- `server/services/gemini.ts` - Enhanced product search and response generation
- `server/services/whatsapp-enhanced.ts` - Added interactive button functionality
- `test-sensor-flow.js` - Test script for verification

## Benefits

- **Better UX**: Users can easily select from multiple options
- **Reduced Errors**: Clear product selection prevents mistakes
- **Scalable**: Works with any vague product name, not just "sensor"
- **Compatible**: Maintains existing functionality while adding new features
